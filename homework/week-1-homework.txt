This week we're all going to make some changes to each others' repositories.

Part 1 - make your own fork of the circus starter template

- Fork the Circus Starter repository (https://github.com/CreativeCircus/circus-starter)

- Edit package.json to include your name instead of Chris'.

- Commit your changes to your own fork.

Now you have a personal copy of the starter template, that you can edit for your own needs.

Part 2 - make a pull request in everyone elses repositories

- Fork each demo project that your classmates made in today's class.

- Make a new branch in each of those forks.

- Change some stuff. Leave a nice message. Add some CSS to make the site prettier.

- Make a pull request to merge those changes back into your classmates' repositories.

- When people make pull requests in your repository, accept or deny them at your discretion. Fix any merge conflicts that may arise.
